**Description:** MATLAB code for numerical experimets of scientific paper "*A Least-Squares Problem of a Linear Tensor Equation of Third-Order for Audio and Color Image Processing*". This paper was submitted to the 2022 45th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (https://tsp.vutbr.cz/). This paper presents two real-life applications for denoising data based on a least-squares problem of a linear tensor equation of third-order. The first numerical experiment is related to removing noise in the sound produced by the blue-throated toucanet, which is a near-passerine bird living in the mountain forests of Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia. This numerical simulation utilizes a sound database taken from the Xeno-canto website [1]. In the second numerical experiment, we present a method for image deconvolution to remove blur or enhance contrast and resolution of a noisy image. This second simulation uses the MASATI database [1].
